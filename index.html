<h3>Joe Gomez</h3>
<img src="LFC/Gomez.jpeg" alt="Joe Gomez">
<p>Joe has played a multitude of different positions this year as he tries to find a way back into the start 11 and way he can. He has played CB, LB, RB and most recently CDM for the Reds. He has been Klopp's utility man this year and will be remembered as a monumental piece of the club if they win the quad.</p>

<h3>Endo</h3>
<img src="LFC/endo.webp" alt="Endo">
<p>Endo, what a signing in the summer. After losing one of the top 5 CDMs in the world this pas summer, LFC made what looked at the time to be a Panic purchase with signing a 31 CDM from the Bundesliga which goes out of the realm of players they usually go for. He has been nothing but perfect for the Reds this season outshining a multitude of players in that position through out the league. For 20 million, this guy has been a bargain buy for the club.</p>
